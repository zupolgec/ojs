In diets T2 and T3 feed was dairy whey-diluted as in group T1. No significant (P>0.05) differences were observed concerning growth parameters (ADG and FCR). Pigs on diets contain- ing PBPS showed significantly higher (P<0.05) percentages of lean cuts and lower percentages of fat cuts. On the whole, ham weight losses during seasoning were moderate but significantly (P<0.05) more marked for PBPS-fed pigs as a prob- able consequence of their lower adiposity degree. Fatty acid composition of ham fat was unaffected by diets. With regard to m. Semimembranosus colour, pigs receiving PBPS showed lower (P<0.05) "L", "a" and "Chroma" values. From an economical point of view it can be concluded that the use of PBPS (partially replacing barley) and dairy whey in heavy pig production could be of particular interest in areas where both these by products are readily available.',
